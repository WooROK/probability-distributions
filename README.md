# 📊 Probability Distributions in Python

This repository contains my study notes and code for exploring **probability distributions** using Python. It includes hands-on examples, visualizations, and calculations with `scipy.stats`, `matplotlib`, and `math`.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- ✅ Factorials and Combinations (with `math.factorial`, `math.comb`)
- ✅ Binomial Distribution: PMF, CDF, mean, variance, sampling
- ✅ Poisson Distribution: theory and visualization
- ✅ Normal Distribution: PDF, CDF, and plots
- ✅ Exponential Distribution: scale vs lambda, visualization
- ✅ Beta Distribution: pdf/cdf/rvs comparison

Each notebook contains:
- 📌 Key concepts and formulas
- 🐍 Python code with comments
- 📈 Graphs using `matplotlib`

## 🧠 Why I Made This

I’m using this repository to:
- Practice Python for statistics
- Build a strong foundation in probability theory
- Document my learning journey
